# QuestBoard

QuestBoard is a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) platform designed to revolutionize the way people seek and provide services. By leveraging the Solana blockchain, QuestBoard aims to create a transparent, secure, and efficient ecosystem for users to post and respond to various types of quests, such as “help wanted”, “looking for services”, or “offering services”.

Traditional service platforms often suffer from issues like high fees, lack of transparency, and centralization, which can lead to mistrust and inefficiency. QuestBoard addresses these challenges by providing a decentralized, open-source platform that ensures secure communication, fair dispute resolution, and minimal fees.
